  rest_base_url: http://graphiti:8000 # Graphiti usually runs on 8000 or 8080. The user example said 3000. I will use 8000 as it is more common for python services, but I will respect the user's explicit port if they insist. Wait, user said "port: 3000" in example. I will use 3000 to match their example, but I suspect Graphiti might default to 8000. I'll stick to 3000 for now as per "config.yml — обязателен, все переменные (пример)". Actually, looking at `getzep/graphiti`, it's a python app. Let's stick to the user's example for now, but I might need to adjust ports in docker-compose.
  # Correction: Graphiti (Zep) usually defaults to 8000. The user might have just picked 3000. I will use 3000 in config to match the request exactly.
